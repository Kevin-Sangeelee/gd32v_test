This was modified from Sipeed's LCD example at

 - https://github.com/sipeed/Longan\_GD32VF\_examples.git

and the GigaDevice GD32V Firmware examples, along with snippets of code found
elsewhere.

It writes text to the LCD display to show the values of some registers, and
shows a counter that updates on a timer interrupt.

It also has an example of inline assembly to execute CSR instructions.
